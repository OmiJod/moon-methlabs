A QBCore Advanced  Methlab Script 

Looking for a unique and thrilling meth run experience in FiveM? Look no further than our script! With a variety of features and configurable options, you'll be able to tailor the experience to your liking.

Our script features a changing location every two hours, adding an extra layer of challenge and excitement to each run. The meth lab key will spawn at a random location on a ship, and peds with high accuracy and body health will protect the box, making it difficult for players to obtain the key. However, once obtained, the lab key will decay after two weeks, so players will need to act fast to make the most of their opportunity.

The meth lab itself uses a key system, and there's even a CCTV camera to help you keep an eye on things. Sanitization is also a key part of the experience, and the lab will only operate during the nighttime.

Players can Buy their items at a designated shop (which can be disabled in config), and there are highly configurable recipes to ensure that each run is unique. Personal and meth lab storage is available, and there are even temperature control minigames to add an extra level of challenge.

With an explosion on failure and a cooldown for the lab, there are consequences for failure, but the smooth interface (thanks to ox_lib) and personal design make this script an immersive and rewarding experience. And best of all, it's an affordable script that's sure to add some excitement to your FiveM gameplay.

Try it out and see for yourself - this meth run is like nothing else you've experienced in FiveM!
